# ClipSync

**ClipSync** is a private, lightweight, and secure browser extension that allows you to sync your clipboard across different devices instantly. No accounts, no cloud storage, and no centralized servers—just your data, moving directly between your devices.

## Features

-   **Private P2P Sync**: Uses WebRTC (via PeerJS) for direct browser-to-browser communication.
-   **End-to-End Encryption**: All synced text is encrypted using AES-GCM with keys derived from your unique sync code.
-   **No Accounts Needed**: Simply generate a 3-word sync code and use it on your other devices to link them.
-   **Clipboard History**: Keeps track of recent clips (up to 20 items) locally on your device.
-   **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with Manifest V3 for optimal performance and security.

## Installation
### Download from GitHub
1.  Go to the [ClipSync GitHub Repository](https://github.com/akinxwumi/clipsync).
2.  Click the **Code** button and clone with Git or select **Download ZIP**.
3.  If you chose Download ZIP, extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.


### Add to Browser

Since ClipSync is not yet published, you can load it as an "unpacked" extension:

1.  Open your Chrome-based browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.).
2.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  In the top-right corner, toggle **Developer mode** to **ON**.
4.  Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears in the top-left.
5.  Select the folder where you extracted/cloned the ClipSync files (the folder containing `manifest.json`).
6.  The ClipSync icon should now appear in your extension list!
7. Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.

## How to Use

1.  **Set Up**: Open the extension popup. Click **Create New Sync Code** on your first device.
2.  **Link Devices**: On your other devices, click **Use Existing Sync Code** and enter the 3-word code generated by the first device.
3.  **Sync**: Copy any text, open the extension, and click the **Sync** button next to the item in your history, or use the **Sync Selected Text** feature.
4.  **Receive**: Synced items will automatically appear on your other linked devices with a notification badge.

## Security & Privacy

-   **Direct Transmission**: Your data never touches our servers. PeerJS is only used for the initial "handshake" to find your other devices.
-   **Local Only**: Your clipboard history is stored only in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
-   **Encrypted by Design**: Even if someone intercepted the P2P stream, they couldn't read your data without your secret sync code.
